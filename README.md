### Shared Packages

- `@biotrakr/types` – canonical domain types shared by API and web clients.
- `@biotrakr/config` – zod-based environment loaders to avoid hard-coded URLs.
- `@biotrakr/utils` – security helpers for hashing, token creation, and guards.
- `@biotrakr/ui` – design tokens to be leveraged by every surface.

### Dashboard Enhancements (Step 9)

- Live telemetry map renders shared RTLS mock data with breadcrumb trails so UI integration can progress ahead of device feeds.
- Maintenance planner surfaces seeded work orders with filtering and priority/status badges, ready for API wiring in later steps.

### Data Pipeline (Step 10)

- `docs/data-pipeline.md` outlines the ingestion contracts, Timescale-friendly storage schema, and configuration required to replace synthetic telemetry with live device feeds.
- Asset QR scans are logged via the `/assets/:id/scans` API and surfaced in the dashboard for rapid reconciliation and audit trails. See [`docs/qr-scanning.md`](./docs/qr-scanning.md) for implementation notes.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0
- Docker >= 24.0.0
- Python >= 3.11 (for ML service)

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
docker-compose up -d

# Run database migrations
cd apps/api
pnpm prisma migrate dev

# Start all services in development mode (via Turborepo)
pnpm dev

# Or run the ML service + tracking stack via Docker
docker-compose up ml-service mlflow
```

### Service Entry Points

Run individual apps when iterating on specific surfaces:

```bash
# API (NestJS)
pnpm --filter @biotrakr/api dev

# Web (Next.js)
pnpm --filter @biotrakr/web dev
```
